# Unmerge-sort
A program to create the worst case for merge sort for my Design of Algorithms class. 

Majority of the code was created by my instructor, Jeffrey Graves. Functions created by me was unmerge_sort and helper. 

This is not a good program, but it works. And I think it's funny that it did.
